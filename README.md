# AsyncInn

What is the purpose of the program?

The purpose of the application is manage a hotel chain business side.  Meaning, managing hotels, rooms ameneties and so on.

How do I run the program?

There is a home page that links to other pages with act as user intefaces for the Hotels Database.  The database consists of 5 tables, a Hotel, Hotel Room, Room, Room Amenatie and Ameneties.  There are 2 composit key tables, the Hotel Room and the Room Aneneties tables. The rest of the table have their own IDs.

So far, I have created a new Web Application, completed the Schema for the Database, made the classes for the schema, migrated the design, created the database added a basic user interface with full CRUD abilities.

The use has the ability to view Hotels, Rooms and Amenties that are currently in the database.  the can choose the option to create a new instance of any of these, they can edit the current Hotels, rooms or amenities and delete any of them.  The drop down boxes are populated with user usefull information in place of ID numbers for example.  They are required to provide all neccessary information before a new instance can be created.

Tools used, C#, ASP.NET Core, SystemIO, Bootstrap, and a shared HTML Layout.
