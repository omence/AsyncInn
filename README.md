# AsyncInn

What is the purpose of the program?

The purpose of the application is manage a hotel chain business side.  Meaning, managing hotels, rooms ameneties and so on.

How do I run the program?

There will be a home page that links to other pages with act as user intefaces for the Hotels Database.  The database consists of 5 tables, a Hotel, Hotel Room, Room, Room Amenatie and Ameneties.  There are 2 composit key tables, the Hotel Room and the Room Aneneties tables. The rest of the table have their own IDs.

So far, I have created a new Web Application, completed the Schema for the Database, made the classes for the schema, migrated the design, and created the database.

The application is still in the beginning stages of development, there is currently no user functionality. 

Tools used, C#, ASP.NET Core, SystemIO Images to come later in development.
