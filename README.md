# AsyncInn

What is the purpose of the program?

The purpose of the application is manage a hotel chain business side.  Meaning, managing hotels, rooms ameneties and so on.

How do I run the program?

There is a home page that links to other pages which act as a user intefaces for the Hotels Database.  The database consists of 5 tables, a Hotel, Hotel Room, Room, Room Amenities and Amenities.  There are 2 composit key tables, the Hotel Room and the Room Anenities tables. The rest of the table have their own IDs. Below is a image of the database schema.

I have created a new Web Application, completed the Schema for the Database, made the classes for the schema, migrated the design, created the database added a basic user interface with full CRUD abilities.

The user has the ability to view Hotels, Rooms, Amenties, hotel rooom and room amenities that are currently in the database.  they can choose the option to create a new instance of any of these, they can edit the current Hotels, rooms or amenities and delete any of them.  The drop down boxes are populated with user useful information in place of ID numbers for example.  They are required to provide all neccessary information before a new instance can be created.

Tools used, C#, ASP.NET Core, SystemIO, Bootstrap, and a shared HTML Layout.
